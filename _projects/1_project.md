This project focuses on the development of an innovative neuromorphic computing-based Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) chip that incorporates Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) to efficiently decode and process brain signals in real-time. The research aims to create low-power, high-integration designs capable of multi-channel EEG signal acquisition with high fidelity.

The innovative approach significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining signal resolution, contributing to advancements in neurorehabilitation, mobile healthcare, and human-computer interaction for wearable and portable devices. The chip's architecture enables efficient processing of neural signals while minimizing energy requirements, making it suitable for long-term implantable and wearable applications.
