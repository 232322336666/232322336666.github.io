## Research Focus

My current research interests center on:

### Multi-channel Signal Acquisition and Ultra-Low Power Circuit Design
Engineering ultra-low noise, ultra-low power circuits for multi-channel EEG signal acquisition, replacing traditional Nyquist-sampling ADC with Delta modulation-based analog pulse conversion for signal sparse coding. This design minimizes power usage and reduces system complexity. Further integrated nonlinear in-memory computation techniques, enhancing processing speed, reducing noise, and overcoming the power and latency limitations typically found in conventional digital circuits. The solution provides a scalable, high-performance architecture suitable for next-generation neurotechnology applications.

### Neuromorphic Computing for BMI Systems
Leading the development of a neuromorphic computing-based Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) chip that incorporates Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) to efficiently decode and process brain signals in real-time. Focused on low-power, high-integration designs to enable multi-channel EEG signal acquisition with high fidelity. This innovative approach significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining signal resolution, contributing to advancements in neurorehabilitation, mobile healthcare, and human-computer interaction for wearable and portable devices.

## Personal Projects & DIY

I have a strong passion for electronics DIY and have successfully replicated several renowned open-source projects:

- **[HoloCubic]({{ '/outcomes/' | relative_url }}#holocubic)** - A mini smart desk display with ESP32-S3
- **[Hanwen Keyboard]({{ '/outcomes/' | relative_url }}#hanwen)** - A custom mechanical keyboard with hot-swap PCB
- **[Reuleaux Triangle]({{ '/outcomes/' | relative_url }}#lailuo)** - A triangular robotic platform with ROS integration

These projects have enhanced my practical skills in PCB design, embedded programming, and mechanical integration. Visit my [Projects & Outcomes]({{ '/outcomes/' | relative_url }}) page for detailed documentation and build logs.
